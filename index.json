However, their efficacy is undermined by undesired and inconsistent behaviors, including hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxic content. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is self-correction, where the LLM itself is prompted or guided to fix problems in its own output. Techniques leveraging automated feedback -- either produced by the LLM itself or some external system -- are of particular interest as they are a promising way to make LLM-based solutions more practical and deployable with minimal human feedback. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this emerging class of techniques. We analyze and taxonomize a wide array of recent work utilizing these strategies, including training-time, generation-time, and post-hoc correction. We also summarize the major applications of this strategy and conclude by discussing future directions and challenges.","tags":[],"title":"Automatically Correcting Large Language Models: Surveying the landscape of diverse self-correction strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liangming Pan","Alon Albalak","Xinyi Wang","William Yang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1685583891,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685583891,"objectID":"d5ac6b87a8647213db55eeb3b5e61f8a","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/logic-llm/","publishdate":"2023-05-31T18:44:51-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/logic-llm/","section":"publication","summary":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like reasoning abilities but still struggle with complex logical problems.

Thus, training on tweets is challenging and demands large-scale human-annotated labels, which are time-consuming and costly to obtain. In this paper, we find that providing hashtags to social media tweets can help alleviate this issue because hashtags can enrich short and ambiguous tweets in terms of various information, such as topic, sentiment, and stance. This motivates us to propose a novel Hashtag-guided Tweet Classification model (HashTation), which automatically generates meaningful hashtags for the input tweet to provide useful auxiliary signals for tweet classification. To generate high-quality and insightful hashtags, our hashtag generation model retrieves and encodes the post-level and entity-level information across the whole corpus. Experiments show that HashTation achieves significant improvements on seven low-resource tweet classification tasks, in which only a limited amount of training data is provided, showing that automatically enriching tweets with model-generated hashtags could significantly reduce the demand for large-scale human-labeled data. Further analysis demonstrates that HashTation is able to generate high-quality hashtags that are consistent with the tweets and their labels.","tags":[],"title":"Hashtag-Guided Low-Resource Tweet Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuan Long Do","Bowei Zou","Liangming Pan","Nancy F Chen","Shafiq Joty","Ai Ti Aw"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1660625776,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660625776,"objectID":"4fa11f651eab61f16bccbda2acef7491","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/coling22-do/","publishdate":"2022-08-15T20:56:16-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/coling22-do/","section":"publication","summary":"Conversational question generation (CQG) serves as a vital task for machines to assist humans, such as interactive reading comprehension, through conversations. Compared to traditional single-turn question generation (SQG), CQG is more challenging in the sense that the generated question is required not only to be meaningful, but also to align with the occurred conversation history. While previous studies mainly focus on how to model the flow and alignment of the conversation, there has been no thorough study to date on which parts of the context and history are necessary for the model. We argue that shortening the context and history is crucial as it can help the model to optimise more on the conversational alignment property. To this end, we propose CoHS-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework, which adopts a CoHS module to shorten the context and history of the input. In particular, CoHS selects contiguous sentences and history turns according to their relevance scores by a top-p strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on CoQA in both the answer-aware and answer-unaware settings.","tags":[],"title":"CoHS-CQG: Context and History Selection for Conversational Question Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huanli Gong","Liangming Pan","Hengchang Hu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1660539347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660539347,"objectID":"acbe05dd99420994e58a06e20569f839","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/coling22-khan/","publishdate":"2022-08-14T20:55:47-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/coling22-khan/","section":"publication","summary":"Designing in-depth educational questions is a time-consuming and cognitively demanding task. Therefore, it is intriguing to study how to build Question Generation (QG) models to automate the question creation process. However, existing QG datasets are not suitable for educational question generation because the questions are not real questions asked by humans during learning and can be solved by simply searching for information. To bridge this gap, we present KHANQ, a challenging dataset for educational question generation, containing 1,034 high-quality learner-generated questions seeking an in-depth understanding of the taught online courses in Khan Academy. Each data sample is carefully paraphrased and annotated as a triple of 1) Context: an independent paragraph on which the question is based; 2) Prompt: a text prompt for the question (eg, the learner’s background knowledge); 3) Question: a deep question based on Context and coherent with Prompt. By conducting a human evaluation on the aspects of appropriateness, coverage, coherence, and complexity, we show that state-of-the-art QG models which perform well on shallow question generation datasets have difficulty in generating useful educational questions.

To this end, we introduce KQA Pro, a dataset for Complex KBQA including around 120K diverse natural language questions. We introduce a compositional and interpretable programming language KoPL to represent the reasoning process of complex questions.

We conduct both automatic and human evaluations in addition to a thorough analysis to explore the effect of each QG-specific reward.

We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases.

This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance.

The network learns image embeddings in hyperbolic space, which is capable of preserving the hierarchical structure of semantic classes in low dimensions. Comparing with existing zero-shot learning approaches, the network is more robust because the embedding feature in hyperbolic space better represents class hierarchy and thereby avoid misleading resulted from unrelated siblings. Our network outperforms exiting baselines under hierarchical evaluation with an extremely challenging setting, i.e., learning only from 1,000 categories to recognize 20,841 unseen categories. While under flat evaluation, it has competitive performance as state-of-the-art methods but with five times lower embedding dimensions.

Nevertheless, the task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling sufficient training data. On one hand, there are hundred thousands of food ingredients in the world, ranging from the common to rare. Collecting training samples for all of the ingredient categories is difficult. On the other hand, as the ingredient appearances exhibit huge visual variance during the food preparation, it requires to collect the training samples under different cooking and cutting methods for robust recognition. Since obtaining sufficient fully annotated training data is not easy, a more practical way of scaling up the recognition is to develop models that are capable of recognizing unseen ingredients. Therefore, in this paper, we target the problem of ingredient recognition with zero training samples. More specifically, we introduce multi-relational GCN (graph convolutional network) that integrates ingredient hirerarchy, attribute as well as co-occurrence for zero-shot ingredient recognition. Extensive experiments on both Chinese and Japanese food datasets are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of multi-relational GCN and shed light on zero-shot ingredients recognition.","tags":[],"title":"Zero-shot Ingredient Recognition by Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569542400,"objectID":"adb0b4493abbb66665061a12c910d5dc","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/project/question-generation/","publishdate":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/question-generation/","section":"project","summary":"A paper list that summarizes the recent papers on neural question generation.","tags":["Question Generation"],"title":"Question Generation Paper List","type":"project"},{"authors":["Liangming Pan","Wenqiang Lei","Tat-Seng Chua","Min-Yan Kan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558490102,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558490102,"objectID":"324bd0be88c04577bede7112b65338ef","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/qg-survey/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T09:55:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/qg-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging research in Neural Question Generation (NQG) has started to integrate a larger variety of inputs, and generating questions requiring higher levels of cognition.

They contextualize the discussion, anchoring the discussion participants' presentation of the issues and their understanding. However, they are usually mentioned in free text, without appropriate hyperlinking to their associated resource. Automated learning resource mention hyperlinking and categorization will facilitate discussion and searching within the MOOC forums and also benefit the contextualization of such resources across disparate views. We propose the novel problem of learning resource mention identification in MOOC forums, i.e., to identify resource mentions in discussions and classify them into pre-defined resource types. As this is a novel task with no publicly available data, we first contribute a large-scale labeled dataset-dubbed the forum resource mention (FoRM) dataset-to facilitate our current research and future research on this task. The FoRM contains over 10 000 real-world forum threads in collaboration with Coursera, with more than 23 000 manually labeled resource mentions. We then formulate this task as a sequence tagging problem and investigate solution architectures to address the problem. Importantly, we identify two major challenges that hinder the applications of sequence tagging models to the task: (1) the diversity of resource mention expression and (2) long-range contextual dependencies. We address these challenges by incorporating character-level and thread context information into an LSTM-CRF model. First, we incorporate a character encoder to address the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by the diversity of mention expressions. Second, to address the context dependency challenge, we encode thread contexts using an RNN-based context encoder and apply the attention mechanism to selectively leverage useful context information during sequence tagging. The experiments on FoRM show that the proposed method improves the baseline deep sequence tagging models notably, significantly bettering performance on instances that exemplify two challenges.","tags":[],"title":"Resource Mention Extraction for MOOC Discussion Forums","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jifan Yu","Liangming Pan","Juanzi Li","Xiaoping Du"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533088584,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533088584,"objectID":"36ea01f4c1e1150ccd81a173616b38c9","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/ccks18/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T09:56:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ccks18/","section":"publication","summary":"Applying data mining techniques to help researchers discover, understand, and predict research trends is a highly beneficial but challenging task.
