Nevertheless, the task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling sufficient training data. On one hand, there are hundred thousands of food ingredients in the world, ranging from the common to rare. Collecting training samples for all of the ingredient categories is difficult. On the other hand, as the ingredient appearances exhibit huge visual variance during the food preparation, it requires to collect the training samples under different cooking and cutting methods for robust recognition. Since obtaining sufficient fully annotated training data is not easy, a more practical way of scaling up the recognition is to develop models that are capable of recognizing unseen ingredients. Therefore, in this paper, we target the problem of ingredient recognition with zero training samples. More specifically, we introduce multi-relational GCN (graph convolutional network) that integrates ingredient hirerarchy, attribute as well as co-occurrence for zero-shot ingredient recognition. Extensive experiments on both Chinese and Japanese food datasets are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of multi-relational GCN and shed light on zero-shot ingredients recognition.","tags":[],"title":"Zero-shot Ingredient Recognition by Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569542400,"objectID":"adb0b4493abbb66665061a12c910d5dc","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/project/question-generation/","publishdate":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/question-generation/","section":"project","summary":"A paper list that summarizes the recent papers on neural question generation.","tags":["Question Generation"],"title":"Question Generation Paper List","type":"project"},{"authors":["Liangming Pan","Wenqiang Lei","Tat-Seng Chua","Min-Yan Kan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558490102,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558490102,"objectID":"324bd0be88c04577bede7112b65338ef","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/qg-survey/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T09:55:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/qg-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging research in Neural Question Generation (NQG) has started to integrate a larger variety of inputs, and generating questions requiring higher levels of cognition.

They contextualize the discussion, anchoring the discussion participants' presentation of the issues and their understanding. However, they are usually mentioned in free text, without appropriate hyperlinking to their associated resource. Automated learning resource mention hyperlinking and categorization will facilitate discussion and searching within the MOOC forums and also benefit the contextualization of such resources across disparate views. We propose the novel problem of learning resource mention identification in MOOC forums, i.e., to identify resource mentions in discussions and classify them into pre-defined resource types. As this is a novel task with no publicly available data, we first contribute a large-scale labeled dataset-dubbed the forum resource mention (FoRM) dataset-to facilitate our current research and future research on this task. The FoRM contains over 10 000 real-world forum threads in collaboration with Coursera, with more than 23 000 manually labeled resource mentions. We then formulate this task as a sequence tagging problem and investigate solution architectures to address the problem. Importantly, we identify two major challenges that hinder the applications of sequence tagging models to the task: (1) the diversity of resource mention expression and (2) long-range contextual dependencies. We address these challenges by incorporating character-level and thread context information into an LSTM-CRF model. First, we incorporate a character encoder to address the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by the diversity of mention expressions. Second, to address the context dependency challenge, we encode thread contexts using an RNN-based context encoder and apply the attention mechanism to selectively leverage useful context information during sequence tagging. The experiments on FoRM show that the proposed method improves the baseline deep sequence tagging models notably, significantly bettering performance on instances that exemplify two challenges.","tags":[],"title":"Resource Mention Extraction for MOOC Discussion Forums","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jifan Yu","Liangming Pan","Juanzi Li","Xiaoping Du"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533088584,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533088584,"objectID":"36ea01f4c1e1150ccd81a173616b38c9","permalink":"https://teacherpeterpan.github.io/publication/ccks18/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T09:56:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ccks18/","section":"publication","summary":"Applying data mining techniques to help researchers discover, understand, and predict research trends is a highly beneficial but challenging task.
